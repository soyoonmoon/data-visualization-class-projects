      <h2>Hallucinator - Diamond data</h2>
      Both map shows the diamonds in terms of carat(x-axis), price(y-axis), and color(color). Diamonds on the left side have high opacity. </br> When the opacity is high, some colors are hidden below, making it seem like certain colors are more common.</br> However, the right side has low opacity interweaved, so that when the diamond is under another diamond, we can still see it.</br> The button changes of ordering of the diamonds; the left side shows big change when the order changes while right side doesn't.

    <div id="partB">
      <h2>Confuser - Mortality data</h2>
      The left map first shows the mortality data of 2020 where states with mortality rate higher than 5.5% is shown through darker blue color and mortality rate lower than 5.5% is shown
      through lighter blue color.</br> Right map shows the more accurate mortality data ranges, with smaller than 4, 4-5, 5-5.5, 5.5-6, 6-7, 7% and higher as data ranges. </br>
      Without specific data range, it is hard to know even when the rate increases/decreases significantly - this is shown through maps after the change is added.

      <h2>Jumbler - Republican vs Democrat </h2>
      Both maps show the political leaning of each state - left side shows them through rainbow colormap and right side shows them through shades of red, blue and purple. </br>
      Because rainbow colormap (different colors in general) are bad at expressing ratio data, even when colors change according to the change in political leaning values it is very hard for viewers to understand </br> However, mix of different shades of blue and red effectively show where the state stands.
