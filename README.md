# data-visualization-class-samples
This work is from data visualization class CMSC 23900 
Note: All the projects were done with my partner, Noah Tan, a second year computer science student. 
He was quite skilled at changing colors, which are my weak points - but I contributed a lot in data cleaning & debugging and 
small details like tool tip.

p2 - nightingale visualization project \n

p3 - Republican - Democrat political leaning map per state (made on hexmap) \n

p4 - A class exercise showing hallucinator/confuser/jumbler.


Also, files such as hexmap.js (template where data was put in) was given by Professor Gordon Kindlmann.
